This is a program designed to scrape the web for internships or anything you want. How it works is that you enter in a keyword such as "internship". Secondly, you list individual search terms to associate with that keyword such as different company names like Apple, Google, or Microsoft.

The program then searches "Apple Internship", "Google Internship" etc.

After that it compiles relevant links into one place for the user. It's like a Google search engine but for multiple 
search engines at once.
