# Internship Web Scraper

### This is a program designed to scrape the web for internships or anything you want. How it works is that you enter in a keyword such as "internship" then press submit. Secondly, you list individual search terms to associate with that keyword such as different company names like Apple, Google, or Microsoft.

### The program then searches "Apple Internship", "Google Internship" etc.

### After that it compiles relevant links into one place for the user. It's like a Google search engine but for multiple 
### search engines at once.

## Start Command: python3 window.py from root directory (or python window.py ) run python --version or python3 --version to see which one you have installed
