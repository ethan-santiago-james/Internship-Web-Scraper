FOUR POSSIBILITIES:

- Site that leads to a job listing
- Site that is a job listing
- Site that is a job posting
- Site that is neither

WHAT TO DO IN EACH SCENARIO:

Site that leads to job listing:

- Look for a button that leads to a job listing

Site that is a job listing:

- Scan for links with relevant keywords

Site that is a job posting:

- Scan for the job title

Site that is neither:

- Leave

HOW CAN WE MAKE A DECISION OF WHAT THE SITE IS? (doesn't have to be perfect)

- Find 20 keywords, and whichever matches the most is chosen

- If cumulative sum of keywords is less than a certain amount, go back
